# hcaptcha-solver

hcaptcha-solver is a lightweight Python library for solving hCaptcha challenges with selenium.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps hcaptcha-solver
```

## Usage

```python
from hcaptcha_solver import hcaptcha_solver
from selenium import webdriver

# create Captcha_Solver object to load ML models
captcha_solver = hcaptcha_solver.Captcha_Solver()

# create webdriver and access website with hCaptcha
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://accounts.hcaptcha.com/demo")

# check for hCaptcha
captcha_solver.is_captcha_present(driver)

# solve hCaptcha
captcha_solver.solve_captcha(driver)

```

## Functionality

Currently, only v1 hCaptchas are supported. Any other captcha types will be skipped.
The correct images are selected using Convolutional Neural Networks trained on labeled hCaptcha data.

The following figure shows the supported captcha types and their labeling accuracy. (Accuracy is inflated since it includes Training Data)
